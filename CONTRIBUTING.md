## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[www.gtalumni.la Code of Conduct](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.gtalumni.lablob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to <hello@gtalumni.la>.

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.gtalumni.la).

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.gtalumni.la/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.gtalumni.la/issues/new/choose).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.gtalumni.la). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.gtalumni.laissues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <hello@gtalumni.la>.

<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.gtalumni.la/issues/new/choose). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the _reproduction steps_ that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-repro`. Bugs with the `needs-repro` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for bugs and errors that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for <www.gtalumni.la>, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.gtalumni.la) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.gtalumni.la/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.gtalumni.la/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most <www.gtalumni.la> users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

<!-- You might want to create an issue template for enhancement suggestions that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->

### Your First Code Contribution

#### Finding an Issue to Work On

The first step to contributing to this project is to find an issue to work on. You can find issues to work on by looking at the [issues](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.gtalumni.la/issues) page. You can filter the issues by label, milestone, assignee, and author. You can also search for issues using the search bar.

Once you have found an issue to work on, you should assign yourself to the issue. This will let other contributors know that you are working on the issue. If you are unable to work on the issue for any reason, you should unassign yourself from the issue so that other contributors can work on it.

#### Creating a Branch

Once you have found an issue to work on, you should create a branch to work on the issue. You can create a branch by running the following command:

```bash
git switch -c <branch-name>   # Create a new branch
```

Make sure to follow the [branching model](#branching-model) when naming your branch.

#### Making Changes

Once you have created a branch, you can make changes to the code. You can run the following command to start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev          # Start the development server
```

You should then be able to visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the website.

You should also be able to run the storybook server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run storybook    # Start the storybook server
```

You should then be able to visit [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view the storybook.

#### Committing Your Changes

Once you have made some changes, you can commit your changes by running the following command:

```bash
git add <file>...    # Stage the changes
git commit           # Commit the changes
```

The commit command will first run the linter to check your code. If there are any errors, you will need to fix them before you can commit your changes. If you are having trouble committing your code, please check the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

Make sure to follow the [commit message guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines) when writing your commit message.

#### Pushing Your Changes

Once you have committed your changes, you can push your changes to your fork by running the following command:

```bash
git push             # Push the changes
```

#### Creating a Pull Request

Once you have pushed your changes, you can create a pull request by visiting the
[pull requests](https://github.com/anguspiv/www.gtalumni.la/pulls) page. You can then click the "New pull request" button to create a new pull request.

Make sure to follow the [pull request guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines) when creating your pull request.

Additionally, we require a linear history on the `main` branch, its encouraged for you to squash your
commits to as few commits as possible. You can squash your commits by running the following command:

```bash
git rebase -i main   # Squash the commits
```

For more information on interactive rebases, follow this guide: [Begginer's Guide to Interactive Rebasing](https://www.internalpointers.com/post/squash-commits-into-one-git)

#### Reviewing Your Pull Request

Once you have created a pull request, you should review your pull request to make sure that it follows the [pull request guidelines](#pull-request-guidelines). You should also make sure that the CI pipeline passes. The CI pipeline will run the tests and lint the code.

#### Requesting a Review

Once you have reviewed your pull request, you can request a review by clicking the "Reviewers" button and selecting a reviewer. You can also add a comment to the pull request to let the reviewer know that you have requested a review.

#### Releasing

Once your pull request has been approved and merged, the CI pipeline will automate the release of your
changes. If CI Pipeline passes, it will then publish the latest changes to the website.

### Improving The Documentation

<!-- TODO
Updating, improving and correcting the documentation

-->

## Styleguides

### AirBnB JavaScript Style Guide

This project follows the [AirBnB JavaScript Style Guide](https://airbnb.io/javascript/react/) with a few exceptions. You can find the exceptions in the [`.eslintrc.json`](.eslintrc.json) file.

These rules are enforced both during git commits and by the CI pipeline. If you are having trouble committing your code, please check the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

### Branching Model

This project mainly follows trunk based development. This means that all changes are made on the `main` branch. This branch is protected and requires a pull request to be merged. The pull request must be reviewed and approved by at least one other team member before it can be merged. The pull request must also pass the CI pipeline before it can be merged. The CI pipeline will run the tests and lint the code.

In addition to `main`, there are other special release branches used by semantic release. See [Semantic Release Configuration - Branches](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/configuration#branches) for more information.

#### Branch Naming

When creating a branch to develop a new feature, you should name the branch `feature/[<issue-number>-]<feature-name>`. When creating a branch to fix a bug, you should name the branch `bugfix/[<issue-number>-]<bug-name>`. When creating a branch to make a change to the documentation, you should name the branch `docs/[<issue-number>-]<change-name>`.

Examples:

```
feature/1-add-foo
bugfix/34-fix-bar
docs/12-update-baz
```

### Commit Messages

This project requires the usage of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages. This is enforced by the CI pipeline. If you are having trouble committing your code, please check the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

These messages are used to automatically generate the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file and to determine the version number of the project. Please make sure to follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification when writing your commit messages.

### Testing

For Testing, the project uses the following frameworks:

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit testing
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing

We require you to write tests for your code as its needed. We encourgage you to follow the guiding princple of testing the behaviour of your code and not the implementation. This means that you should not test private functions or functions that are not exported. You should also not test the implementation details of a function. You should only test the behaviour of the function.

We also encourage writing your tests first, and then writing the code to make the tests pass. This is called [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (TDD). This is not a requirement, but it is encouraged.

### Folder Structure

The project follows the [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) methodology for structuring the components. This means that the components are split into the following categories:

- **Atoms** `src/components/atoms/` - The smallest building blocks of the application. These are the basic HTML elements such as `button`, `input`, `form`, etc.
- **Molecules** `src/components/molecules/` - These are groups of atoms that form a small unit of functionality. These are usually more complex than atoms and can be reused throughout the application.
- **Organisms** `src/components/organisms/` - These are groups of molecules that form a section of the application. These are usually more complex than molecules and can be reused throughout the application.
- **Templates** `src/components/templates/` - These are groups of organisms that form a page of the application. These are usually more complex than organisms and can be reused throughout the application.

In addition to the components, the project also has the following folders:

- **Pages** `src/pages/` - These are the pages of the application. These are usually composed of templates and are not reusable.
- **Lib** `src/lib/` - These are utility functions that are for generally for specific use cases, such as fetching data from the folder structure.
- **Styles** `src/styles/` - These are the global styles of the application. These are usually for setting up the theme and global styles.
- **Utils** `src/utils/` - These are utility functions that are reusable throughout components and the application.
