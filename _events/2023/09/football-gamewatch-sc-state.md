Join us on Saturday as Tech looks to bounce back from a season-opening loss against this year's FCS opponent, South Carolina State.

We will be meeting at The Garage on Motor in Culver City. The Garage on Motor is a great place to watch the game with plenty of TVs and a great selection of food and drinks. Parking is available in the lot next the restaurant or on the street. Please RSVP so we can get an idea of how many people will be attending, but feel free to come even if you don't RSVP.

We look forward to seeing you there!
