Connect with Jackets and celebrate Tech's spirit in your community at Ramble the Night. Join old friends and make new ones as we share memories and celebrate Georgia Tech's impact across the globe for one night only. Yellow Jackets share bonds that last a lifetime, no matter where life takes you. Light appetizers will be provided!

The venue is located in the heart of the Arts District with plenty of paid parking lots. The brewery is also accessible via public transportation, with nearby Metro stops.

Additionally, we are looking for volunteers to help run and expand the Los Angeles Alumni Association's events. If you're interested in volunteering, please feel free to reach out to us at [hello@gtalumni.la](mailto:hello@gtalumni.la) for more information, or look for Angus Perkerson (the guy with the food tab!).

See you there!
