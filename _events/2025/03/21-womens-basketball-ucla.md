> We are so excited to be traveling out west for the first and hopefully second round of the NCAA tournament this weekend. Because we are so far from Atlanta, we really are trying to find some local fans to help give us a crowd.
> We play at 4:30 pm PT on Friday vs Richmond. The game is at UCLA. If we win on Friday, we will likely play UCLA on Sunday (pending they win their first-round game). The time for Sunday's game is still TBD.
> I know this is last minute and we don't have all the details yet, but I at least wanted to reach out and get this on your radar. Even if we had 10 alums present and cheering it could make a difference for us!

Talking with Becca they are working on buying a section of tickets for Alumni and Team Family and Friends. They don't have details on the ticket cost yet, but they would REALLY love some support from the Alumni. As I get more details I will update the details here, and also on our facebook group
